* Add loading indicator on dashboard while awaiting initial API response. #5427

#### <sub><sup><a name="5472" href="#5472">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* The dashboard page refreshes its data every 5 seconds. Until now, it was possible (especially for admin users) for the dashboard to initiate an ever-growing number of API calls, unnecessarily consuming browser, network and API resources. Now the dashboard will not initiate a request for more data until the previous request finishes. #5472
