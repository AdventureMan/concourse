#### <sub><sup><a name="5340" href="#5340">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* Added a flag, `--disable-list-all-jobs`. When this flag is passed, the /api/v1/jobs endpoint (which is known to have [performance issues](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/5341)) will always return an empty JSON array instead of making complex and expensive database operations. The most significant end-user impact of this change should be that the dashboard will no longer display pipeline previews. #5340
