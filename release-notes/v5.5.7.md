* Updates the git resource to [v1.6.3](https://github.com/concourse/git-resource/releases/tag/v1.6.3) to address a recently reported security vulnerability:
    * [CVE-2019-19604](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-19604):
        * Arbitrary command execution is possible in Git before 2.20.2, 2.21.x before 2.21.1, 2.22.x before 2.22.2, 2.23.x before 2.23.1, and 2.24.x before 2.24.1 because a "git submodule update" operation can run commands found in the .gitmodules file of a malicious repository.

#### <sub><sup><a name="4912" href="#4912">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* @vito bumped the `autocert` dependency so that Let's Encrypt will default to the ACME v2 API. #4912

  > Note: This backported fix includes the bump to the default value, which was
  > originally a follow-up patch in v5.7.3.
