* Updates the git resource to [v1.6.3](https://github.com/concourse/git-resource/releases/tag/v1.6.3) to address a recently reported security vulnerability:
    * [CVE-2019-19604](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-19604):
        * Arbitrary command execution is possible in Git before 2.20.2, 2.21.x before 2.21.1, 2.22.x before 2.22.2, 2.23.x before 2.23.1, and 2.24.x before 2.24.1 because a "git submodule update" operation can run commands found in the .gitmodules file of a malicious repository.
