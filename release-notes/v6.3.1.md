* Fix Gitlab connector configuration using Full Name instead of Username
  * Any Concourse teams configured with Gitlab users may need to be updated. Previously a Gitlab users Full Name was used to add them to a Concourse team. Now the users Username in Gitlab is used by Concourse to verify team membership. If the Full Name and Username are the same then no change is necessary.
