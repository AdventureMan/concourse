* Fix an edge case of [CVE-2018-15798](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-15798/) where redirect URI during login flow could be embedded with a malicious host.

#### <sub><sup><a name="v528-note-2" href="v528-note-2">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* Added a flag, `--disable-list-all-jobs`. When this flag is passed, the /api/v1/jobs endpoint (which is known to have [performance issues](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/5341)) will always return an empty JSON array instead of making complex and expensive database operations. The most significant end-user impact of this change should be that the dashboard will no longer display pipeline previews. #5340
